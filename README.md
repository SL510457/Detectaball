Detectaball is a school project made by our team (4 university student), we aim for making a mobile app to be used as an intelligent scoreboard, so that the player will no longer be frustrated when they forgot what's the score. In addition, we want to provide an analytic system to let the user know their strengths and weaknesses, thereby allowing them to improve their performance.

## Computer Vision
In this project we uses OpenCV and python to process the video
## detectaball_app
We uses flutter to create the UI for this mobile app

## Training Mode
The training mode in this app is built to track every ball's landing position.
### The following are the three steps the system will perform
#### 1.Step one: get the table position
